        <h3>Before you cook Beans Porridge</h3>

        <ol type="i">
            <li>
                Soak the beans in cold water for 5 hours. Boil the beans for 5 minutes <br>
                and discard the water. Wash the beans in cold water and set aside.<br> 
                This soaking and pre-cooking process will help reduce the gas inducing <br>
                elements.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Chop the onions, grind the crayfish (if you are using it) and pepper.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                If you will use yam/plantain/sweet potatoes, wash, peel and cut them <br>
                into 1 inch cubes and set aside. If you will use baby corn, drain the <br>
                preservation liquid, rinse and set aside.    
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>

        <ol type="i">
            <li>
                Put the beans in a pot and pour water up to the level of the beans <br>
                and start cooking.
                <br>
                Note: If you have a pressure cooker, beans is one of the staple foods <br>
                you will want to use it for. It reduces the cooking time considerably.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                Cook till tender, adding more water from time to time, if necessary. <br>
                Always keep the water at the same level as the beans so that when the<br>
                beans is done, you will not have too much water in the porridge.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                When the beans porridge is soft, add the onions, crayfish (if using it),<br>
                pepper and seasoning.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                Add the red palm oil, salt to taste and cook for more 5 minutes on medium heat.
                <br>
                Note:To get the most out of beans, it is best to cook it with one of the following:<br>
                sweet yam, ripe/unripe plantain, sweet potatoes or baby corn. If you will add any <br>
                of these, this is when to do so. Then instead of cooking for 5 minutes, cook till<br>
                the added yam / plantain / potatoes is done. The baby corn should be added when you<br>
                turn off the heat in step 5.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                Turn off the heat, add the baby corn (if you have chosen to use it), leave to stand<br>
                for 5 minutes and turn the porridge with a wooden spoon.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The beans porridge is ready. If you cooked the beans porridge without any of the additions,<br>
            serve with Fried Plantain, Fried Yam or fried sweet potatoes.
