First Odin lead project: Recipes

This project is in a bid of me mastering web development and i have chosen

This is basically my first project on HTML and i hope to do well here too

Just like the name is a link to different recipes as i deem fit

What i will learn by completing this is in regards to HTML foundation topics like:
Elements and Tags, Boilerplate, links and images, lists and commit messages.
